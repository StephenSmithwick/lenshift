# Lenshift
*Lenshift brings clarity amid bias, distortion, and lies.*

**Lenshift** is a tool for analyzing online and real-world information through multiple lenses: bias, funding sources, missing facts, authorship, and more. The goal is to help users make sense of the information they consume and uncover what may be hidden, distorted, or omitted.

## Vision

Lenshift is not a news aggregator. Itâ€™s an **analysis tool** that will help you:

- Understand the **origin** of information (e.g., wire services, press releases, independent research)
- Identify **funding sources** and ownership structures
- Spot **missing key facts** by comparing coverage
- Determine whether content was **generated by AI**

The project aims to support both **casual news readers** and **journalists and researchers**.

## Structure

This will evolve as development progresses. For now, I plan to organize the repo around the lenses.

### Planned Features

- Modular Lens system to categorize and analyse various media providing further context
  - AI detection for Images, Text, Video, and audio
  - Cross-article fact comparison
  - Origin detection - is the article, image laregly based on other content, what are it's sources
